      <h2>Nomad Bikes experience commitments</h2>
      <p>
        These terms cover the Nomad Bikes storefront, checkout windows, and support services. By reserving a bike or submitting a
        request, you agree to the requirements listed below.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="policy-card">
      <h3>Reservations & delivery</h3>
      <p>
        Reservation details submitted through the checkout page enable our concierge team to coordinate a build window. We do not
        charge the card immediately; instead, you will receive an email confirmation and a quick follow-up call to finalize the order.
        Cancellations or reschedules require at least 24 hours' notice so we can reallocate assembly time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We delight in hand-inspecting every Nomad bike prior to pickup, and we honor a two-year structural warranty supported by
        documented serial numbers collected during the reservation process.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="policy-card">
      <h3>Support commitments</h3>
      <p>
        Support inquiries are addressed in the order received, typically within one business day during our Monday through Friday,
        9:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST window. Provide accurate contact details, and our staff may ask for photos or quick video clips to
        triage mechanical issues before booking a bench session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nomad Bikes reserves the right to provide service estimates when significant customizations or part upgrades are involved. Any
        estimations and pricing will be reflected in the follow-up communication, never via an unsolicited charge.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="policy-card">
      <h3>User responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        Provide accurate and truthful information in all forms. Misrepresentation, repeated misuse of forms, or attempts to bypass the
        concierge call may result in temporary suspension of service privileges. If we detect suspicious activity, we may pause
        purchases until verification is complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nomad Bikes will never request full card details through unencrypted email or messaging platforms. Always confirm you are
        communicating through hello@go4profit.us before sharing sensitive information.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="policy-card">
      <h3>Disputes</h3>
      <p>
        Any disagreements around service, warranties, or billing should be reported to hello@go4profit.us. We aim to resolve
        concerns informally, but retain the right to pursue arbitration if a resolution cannot be reached. Continued do-not-contact
        requests will be honored promptly.
